# 🦖 DINO RUNNER

A dinosaur runner game with the introduction of some physical concepts. It does not aim to realistically simulate physical effects.

## 📖 Description

DINO RUNNER is an educational game that combines fun gameplay and some physical concepts. Control a dinosaur character through various environments while experiencing realistic forces like friction, wind resistance, and gravity.

## ✨ Features

- **Physics Engine**: Simulation of forces, friction, and collisions
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust mass, gravity, friction coefficients, and more
- **Multiple Environments**: Grass, sand, ice, and asphalt surfaces with different properties
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Wind forces that affect gameplay
- **Interactive GUI**: PyQt5-based configuration interface
- **Special Elements**: Trampolines with collision coefficients
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasing challenge as your score grows

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **LEFT/RIGHT ARROW**: Move dinosaur
- **SPACE/UP ARROW**: Jump
- **R**: Restart game
- **M**: Return to menu
- **Q**: Quit game

### Game Modes
- **Standard Mode**: Pre-configured physics settings
- **Experimental Mode**: Fully customizable parameters
