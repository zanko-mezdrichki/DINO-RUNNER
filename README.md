# 🦖 DINO RUNNER

A dinosaur runner game with the introduction of some physical concepts. It does not aim to realistically simulate physical effects. Designed to try to combine, not accurately, fun and physics.

## ✨ Features

- **Physics Concepts**: Simulation of forces, friction, and collisions
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust mass, gravity, friction coefficients, and more
- **Multiple Environments**: Grass, sand, ice, and asphalt surfaces with different properties
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Wind forces that affect gameplay
- **Interactive GUI**: PyQt5-based configuration interface
- **Special Elements**: Trampolines with collision coefficients
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasing challenge as your score grows

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **LEFT/RIGHT ARROW**: Move dinosaur
- **SPACE/UP ARROW**: Jump

### Game Modes
- **Standard Mode**: Pre-configured physics settings
- **Experimental Mode**: Fully customizable parameters
